# simpleqrscanner

## Simple QR Code scanner plugin for Construct 2.

In the capx folder, an example of use is provided. The plugin is very simple: three kinds of events are available (success, cancel and error), and one action (decode).

This Construct 2 plugin uses the gizscanqrcode Cordova plugin. That plugin is available in [https://github.com/rafaelfl/cordova-gizwits-scan-qrcode](https://github.com/rafaelfl/cordova-gizwits-scan-qrcode).

If you are using the Cocoon.io, just add it to your plugins list, or add `<plugin name="https://github.com/rafaelfl/cordova-gizwits-scan-qrcode.git" spec="https://github.com/rafaelfl/cordova-gizwits-scan-qrcode.git"/>` to your `config.xml`.

It's really simple! Enjoy it! :)

If you liked the plugin, or even you you have a suggestion (ou a bug correction >.<), send me an email!
